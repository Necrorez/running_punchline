# Project created for GGJ (Global Game Jam 2024)

The game is made with Godot 4.2.

Main logic behind this game is that you are a joke inspector and if you find somebody being funny you need to catch them and hit them with a plank.

Main controlls:

A,W,S,D - walking.

Mouse - looking around.

Left mouse click - interacting/attacking

Space - jumping.

Only the first level is somewhat finished.
